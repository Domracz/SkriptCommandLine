### SkriptCommandLine
A skript manager for packages, files and much more

### Adding a package to the repository
To request a package addition, please create an issue. You **MUST** specify the code for the package.
Files **DO NOT** have to be hosted on this repo. You can host it in whatever you want, but you must host it 24/7 so CMD can download you're files. If you want to host your files on this repo, please say in your issue, and we will add your file(s) for you.

### Installing SkriptCommandLine
First, make sure you have skUtilities installed. **https://github.com/tim740/skUtilities/** The installer needs to download and install files.
To install the command line, download the installer.sk file and put it in your scripts folder. **SERVER/plugins/skript/scripts/**
Restart your server, and wait in the console for the skript to load. Once the skript has loaded, it will download all the cmd files.
After the installer downloads everything, your server will restart a second time. After this restart, the skript will be installed.

### If you love to make things difficult...
You can also install SkriptCommandLine manually. You must create the _CMD folder in your scripts folder, then download all the files in the "code" directory in the github. You place them in the _CMD folder, and restart your server. You need to install skBee, skUtilities and skQuery before then finally, restarting your server.
